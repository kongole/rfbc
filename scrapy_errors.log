The Summit included panel discussions about building partnerships along the grain supply chain, enhancing direct and intermediated marketing, and creating new business grain-based relationships in Colorado and beyond. \n A special feature of the Summit was a focus on  The Rye Resurgence Project  which promotes the production and consumption of rye – a heritage grain and winter cover crop that uses less water, improves soil health, and has a complex flavor profile for a variety of uses. Summit participants were able to taste-test four rye varieties grown at different locations in Colorado, and even take home some rye flour! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shared Kitchen Toolkit -    \n \n \n \n \xa0February 20, 2025   \n \n \n \n Introducing the 2nd Edition Shared Kitchen Toolkit!   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Read More \n \n \n February 20, 2025 \n The  Shared Kitchen Toolkit  is the ultimate resource for shared kitchen operators, providing best practices, expert insights, and practical tools to help kitchens thrive.

The Islands and Remote Areas RFBC is unique in many ways, therefore our challenges and proposed responses are unique.  Our challenges include:\xa0  Geographic isolation, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts, Colonial histories, large indigenous populations, and legal issues (not all states, some are territories and commonwealths). \xa0 Our responses include: We aim to promote accessibility to flexible capital and technical assistance (TA) for food and farm businesses through the establishment of a  centralized online platform  that brings together farmers, food businesses, TA providers, and funders. Business Builder Subawards  - We will be aiming to support increased local food production for small-scale marginalized farmers and producers  - many of whom are indigenous producers -  by offering funding for their specific needs, including machinery, inputs, equipment, and other essential infrastructure, including existing and emerging distribution systems, based on our network of food hubs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Our Partners \n \n \n \n Alaska Food Policy Council  The Alaska Food Policy Council (AFPC) is a dedicated organization working to develop and implement effective food policies for the benefit of all Alaskans. AFPC connects, advocates, and informs, to strengthen food systems for all Alaskans, with the vision of creating a healthier, more secure, and more resilient Alaska. Comprised of diverse stakeholders from government agencies, non-profit organizations, and the private sector, the AFPC is committed to creating a resilient and sustainable food system for all Alaskans \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n U.S. Virgin Islands Good Food Coalition The US Virgin Islands Good Food Coalition is dedicated to promoting local food systems by connecting food producers, distributors, and consumers.

Geography:  Hawaiʻi, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Summary:   This Center serves the Nation’s Island States, Territories, and Commonwealths listed above. While not contiguous, these islands and remote areas face similar challenges including, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts and legal barriers such as highly regulated shipping requirements and exclusions from regional free trade agreements. The region relies on imports for over 90% of their food supply putting them at extreme risk of supply chain disruptions and high food prices."}

The Islands and Remote Areas RFBC is unique in many ways, therefore our challenges and proposed responses are unique.  Our challenges include:\xa0  Geographic isolation, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts, Colonial histories, large indigenous populations, and legal issues (not all states, some are territories and commonwealths). \xa0 Our responses include: We aim to promote accessibility to flexible capital and technical assistance (TA) for food and farm businesses through the establishment of a  centralized online platform  that brings together farmers, food businesses, TA providers, and funders. Business Builder Subawards  - We will be aiming to support increased local food production for small-scale marginalized farmers and producers  - many of whom are indigenous producers -  by offering funding for their specific needs, including machinery, inputs, equipment, and other essential infrastructure, including existing and emerging distribution systems, based on our network of food hubs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Our Partners \n \n \n \n Alaska Food Policy Council  The Alaska Food Policy Council (AFPC) is a dedicated organization working to develop and implement effective food policies for the benefit of all Alaskans. AFPC connects, advocates, and informs, to strengthen food systems for all Alaskans, with the vision of creating a healthier, more secure, and more resilient Alaska. Comprised of diverse stakeholders from government agencies, non-profit organizations, and the private sector, the AFPC is committed to creating a resilient and sustainable food system for all Alaskans \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n U.S. Virgin Islands Good Food Coalition The US Virgin Islands Good Food Coalition is dedicated to promoting local food systems by connecting food producers, distributors, and consumers.

Geography:  Hawaiʻi, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Summary:   This Center serves the Nation’s Island States, Territories, and Commonwealths listed above. While not contiguous, these islands and remote areas face similar challenges including, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts and legal barriers such as highly regulated shipping requirements and exclusions from regional free trade agreements. The region relies on imports for over 90% of their food supply putting them at extreme risk of supply chain disruptions and high food prices."}

The Summit included panel discussions about building partnerships along the grain supply chain, enhancing direct and intermediated marketing, and creating new business grain-based relationships in Colorado and beyond. \n A special feature of the Summit was a focus on  The Rye Resurgence Project  which promotes the production and consumption of rye – a heritage grain and winter cover crop that uses less water, improves soil health, and has a complex flavor profile for a variety of uses. Summit participants were able to taste-test four rye varieties grown at different locations in Colorado, and even take home some rye flour! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shared Kitchen Toolkit -    \n \n \n \n \xa0February 20, 2025   \n \n \n \n Introducing the 2nd Edition Shared Kitchen Toolkit!   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Read More \n \n \n February 20, 2025 \n The  Shared Kitchen Toolkit  is the ultimate resource for shared kitchen operators, providing best practices, expert insights, and practical tools to help kitchens thrive.

While not contiguous, these islands and remote areas face similar challenges including, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts and legal barriers such as highly regulated shipping requirements and exclusions from regional free trade agreements. The region relies on imports for over 90% of their food supply putting them at extreme risk of supply chain disruptions and high food prices."}

The Summit included panel discussions about building partnerships along the grain supply chain, enhancing direct and intermediated marketing, and creating new business grain-based relationships in Colorado and beyond. \n A special feature of the Summit was a focus on  The Rye Resurgence Project  which promotes the production and consumption of rye – a heritage grain and winter cover crop that uses less water, improves soil health, and has a complex flavor profile for a variety of uses. Summit participants were able to taste-test four rye varieties grown at different locations in Colorado, and even take home some rye flour! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shared Kitchen Toolkit -    \n \n \n \n \xa0February 20, 2025   \n \n \n \n Introducing the 2nd Edition Shared Kitchen Toolkit!   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Read More \n \n \n February 20, 2025 \n The  Shared Kitchen Toolkit  is the ultimate resource for shared kitchen operators, providing best practices, expert insights, and practical tools to help kitchens thrive.

The Islands and Remote Areas RFBC is unique in many ways, therefore our challenges and proposed responses are unique.  Our challenges include:\xa0  Geographic isolation, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts, Colonial histories, large indigenous populations, and legal issues (not all states, some are territories and commonwealths). \xa0 Our responses include: We aim to promote accessibility to flexible capital and technical assistance (TA) for food and farm businesses through the establishment of a  centralized online platform  that brings together farmers, food businesses, TA providers, and funders. Business Builder Subawards  - We will be aiming to support increased local food production for small-scale marginalized farmers and producers  - many of whom are indigenous producers -  by offering funding for their specific needs, including machinery, inputs, equipment, and other essential infrastructure, including existing and emerging distribution systems, based on our network of food hubs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Our Partners \n \n \n \n Alaska Food Policy Council  The Alaska Food Policy Council (AFPC) is a dedicated organization working to develop and implement effective food policies for the benefit of all Alaskans.

Geography:  Hawaiʻi, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Summary:   This Center serves the Nation’s Island States, Territories, and Commonwealths listed above. While not contiguous, these islands and remote areas face similar challenges including, food transport logistics, underdeveloped infrastructure, extreme climate change impacts and legal barriers such as highly regulated shipping requirements and exclusions from regional free trade agreements. The region relies on imports for over 90% of their food supply putting them at extreme risk of supply chain disruptions and high food prices."}

The Summit included panel discussions about building partnerships along the grain supply chain, enhancing direct and intermediated marketing, and creating new business grain-based relationships in Colorado and beyond. \n A special feature of the Summit was a focus on  The Rye Resurgence Project  which promotes the production and consumption of rye – a heritage grain and winter cover crop that uses less water, improves soil health, and has a complex flavor profile for a variety of uses. Summit participants were able to taste-test four rye varieties grown at different locations in Colorado, and even take home some rye flour! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shared Kitchen Toolkit -    \n \n \n \n \xa0February 20, 2025   \n \n \n \n Introducing the 2nd Edition Shared Kitchen Toolkit!   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Read More \n \n \n February 20, 2025 \n The  Shared Kitchen Toolkit  is the ultimate resource for shared kitchen operators, providing best practices, expert insights, and practical tools to help kitchens thrive.

TIMESTAMPS                     top of page Providing\xa0 technical assistance and capacity-building opportunities  for Native food producers Intertribal Agriculture Council (IAC) will establish the Intertribal Food Business Center—the only USDA food business center prioritizing Indian Country—to impact the greater food system nationwide. This investment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities directs resources toward healing broken food systems that have underserved and exploited Native peoples for centuries. There is a great need for a Native-led organization to create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities, and IAC is uniquely equipped to lead this effort. \u200b The Intertribal Food Business Center will work to create new markets and expand current linkages throughout the supply chain to address challenges faced by Native food and farm businesses. IAC will partner with other Native organizations—including  Akiptan , the  Indian Land Tenure Foundation , and the  Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative —to develop a coordinated national food system development plan that supports the growth and expansion of American Indian and Alaska Native food businesses. The focus will be on small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses, with more than 65% of the funding allocated for capacity-building awards. \u200b Offerings of the Intertribal Food Business Center may be accessed by any Native producer. The Intertribal Food Business Center aims to be supportive and inclusive of the needs of Indian Country's food systems and food system stewards. Our intention is to serve food systems stewards who may identify as farmers, ranchers, fishers, gatherers, value-added food producers, food product aggregators, distributors, food business owners, and more. We will intentionally define our eligibility criteria to be inclusive in every way possible as we are aware of the historical exclusion from USDA funding support that Indian Country food systems stewards have endured. The  Regional Food Business Centers  and the Intertribal Food Business Center offer Native producers the opportunity for both expanded Technical Assistance Support and Business Builder Awards. As a Native producer, you may receive Technical Assistance Support from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. There is no limit to the amount of Technical Assistance Support you can pursue between the Centers. As a Native producer, you may seek Business Builder Awards from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. The total Business Builder Awards received by a single entity cannot exceed $100,000 between both Centers. \u200b Regional Centers are located in the following areas:   Appalachia   Delta   Rio Grande Colonias   Great Lakes Midwest   Heartland   Islands & Remote Areas   North Central   Northeast   Northwest & Rocky Mountain   Southeast   Southwest  EMPOWER Uplift Native producers with increased investment and support GROWTH Developing the abilities, processes, and resources agribusinesses need to adapt\xa0 REBUILD Create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities “With over 35 years of experience in food and business development work, the Intertribal Agriculture Council is excited about this opportunity to expand access to Native food producers and Tribal food systems that empower self-determination in Indian Country.

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.  History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

This investment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities directs resources toward healing broken food systems that have underserved and exploited Native peoples for centuries. There is a great need for a Native-led organization to create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities, and IAC is uniquely equipped to lead this effort. \u200b The Intertribal Food Business Center will work to create new markets and expand current linkages throughout the supply chain to address challenges faced by Native food and farm businesses. IAC will partner with other Native organizations—including  Akiptan , the  Indian Land Tenure Foundation , and the  Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative —to develop a coordinated national food system development plan that supports the growth and expansion of American Indian and Alaska Native food businesses. The focus will be on small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses, with more than 65% of the funding allocated for capacity-building awards. \u200b Offerings of the Intertribal Food Business Center may be accessed by any Native producer. The Intertribal Food Business Center aims to be supportive and inclusive of the needs of Indian Country's food systems and food system stewards. Our intention is to serve food systems stewards who may identify as farmers, ranchers, fishers, gatherers, value-added food producers, food product aggregators, distributors, food business owners, and more. We will intentionally define our eligibility criteria to be inclusive in every way possible as we are aware of the historical exclusion from USDA funding support that Indian Country food systems stewards have endured. The  Regional Food Business Centers  and the Intertribal Food Business Center offer Native producers the opportunity for both expanded Technical Assistance Support and Business Builder Awards. As a Native producer, you may receive Technical Assistance Support from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. There is no limit to the amount of Technical Assistance Support you can pursue between the Centers. As a Native producer, you may seek Business Builder Awards from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. The total Business Builder Awards received by a single entity cannot exceed $100,000 between both Centers. \u200b Regional Centers are located in the following areas:   Appalachia   Delta   Rio Grande Colonias   Great Lakes Midwest   Heartland   Islands & Remote Areas   North Central   Northeast   Northwest & Rocky Mountain   Southeast   Southwest  EMPOWER Uplift Native producers with increased investment and support GROWTH Developing the abilities, processes, and resources agribusinesses need to adapt\xa0 REBUILD Create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities “With over 35 years of experience in food and business development work, the Intertribal Agriculture Council is excited about this opportunity to expand access to Native food producers and Tribal food systems that empower self-determination in Indian Country.

Technical Assistance \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide direct business technical assistance to small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses (producers, processors, distributors, and other businesses within the food supply chain) and food value and supply chain coordination. Each Regional Food Center will identify priority areas for technical assistance\u202f(e.g.,\u202faggregation/distribution, specialty crop processing for institutions) for the region it plans to serve. Capacity Building \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide financial assistance through business builder subawards up to $100,000 to support projects focused on emerging regional needs and businesses that are working towards expansion and other investment. These subawards may support staff time, business planning activities, software implementation, the purchase of equipment, such as food safety, processing and packaging equipment, value chain and supply chain coordination and innovation, product development, marketing, and other expenses as outlined in the RFA. \u200b \u200b Our business is interested in the Business Builder awards.

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.  History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.  The main site for Archive Team is at  archiveteam.org  and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.    The Archive Team Panic Downloads  are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

TIMESTAMPS                     top of page Providing\xa0 technical assistance and capacity-building opportunities  for Native food producers Intertribal Agriculture Council (IAC) will establish the Intertribal Food Business Center—the only USDA food business center prioritizing Indian Country—to impact the greater food system nationwide. This investment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities directs resources toward healing broken food systems that have underserved and exploited Native peoples for centuries. There is a great need for a Native-led organization to create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities, and IAC is uniquely equipped to lead this effort. \u200b The Intertribal Food Business Center will work to create new markets and expand current linkages throughout the supply chain to address challenges faced by Native food and farm businesses. IAC will partner with other Native organizations—including  Akiptan , the  Indian Land Tenure Foundation , and the  Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative —to develop a coordinated national food system development plan that supports the growth and expansion of American Indian and Alaska Native food businesses. The focus will be on small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses, with more than 65% of the funding allocated for capacity-building awards. \u200b Offerings of the Intertribal Food Business Center may be accessed by any Native producer. The Intertribal Food Business Center aims to be supportive and inclusive of the needs of Indian Country's food systems and food system stewards. Our intention is to serve food systems stewards who may identify as farmers, ranchers, fishers, gatherers, value-added food producers, food product aggregators, distributors, food business owners, and more. We will intentionally define our eligibility criteria to be inclusive in every way possible as we are aware of the historical exclusion from USDA funding support that Indian Country food systems stewards have endured. The  Regional Food Business Centers  and the Intertribal Food Business Center offer Native producers the opportunity for both expanded Technical Assistance Support and Business Builder Awards. As a Native producer, you may receive Technical Assistance Support from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. There is no limit to the amount of Technical Assistance Support you can pursue between the Centers. As a Native producer, you may seek Business Builder Awards from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. The total Business Builder Awards received by a single entity cannot exceed $100,000 between both Centers. \u200b Regional Centers are located in the following areas:   Appalachia   Delta   Rio Grande Colonias   Great Lakes Midwest   Heartland   Islands & Remote Areas   North Central   Northeast   Northwest & Rocky Mountain   Southeast   Southwest  EMPOWER Uplift Native producers with increased investment and support GROWTH Developing the abilities, processes, and resources agribusinesses need to adapt\xa0 REBUILD Create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities “With over 35 years of experience in food and business development work, the Intertribal Agriculture Council is excited about this opportunity to expand access to Native food producers and Tribal food systems that empower self-determination in Indian Country. Our collaboration with the USDA in standing up the Intertribal Food Business Center will heal broken food systems and build sustainable economic growth for our communities.” Kari Jo Lawrence  The Food Centers will have three main responsibilities: Coordination \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will act as regional hubs coordinating across geographic areas, with USDA, other federal, state, and tribal agencies with relevant resources, regional commissions, and the other Regional Food Centers. They will conduct outreach to underserved communities and businesses. Technical Assistance \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide direct business technical assistance to small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses (producers, processors, distributors, and other businesses within the food supply chain) and food value and supply chain coordination. Each Regional Food Center will identify priority areas for technical assistance\u202f(e.g.,\u202faggregation/distribution, specialty crop processing for institutions) for the region it plans to serve. Capacity Building \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide financial assistance through business builder subawards up to $100,000 to support projects focused on emerging regional needs and businesses that are working towards expansion and other investment. These subawards may support staff time, business planning activities, software implementation, the purchase of equipment, such as food safety, processing and packaging equipment, value chain and supply chain coordination and innovation, product development, marketing, and other expenses as outlined in the RFA. \u200b \u200b Our business is interested in the Business Builder awards. How can we learn more about them?  Businesses that are interested in applying for a capacity building subaward through an USDA Regional Food Business Center should directly contact the organization leading the Center that represents their respective geographical location. You can find a list of each organization that is leading a Center, along with a map demonstrating the regional coverage of each Center, on the\xa0 Overview page \xa0of the Regional Food Business Center website. While subawards are critical components of all 12 Regional Food Business Centers, each Center is taking a slightly different approach to how businesses can apply for a subaward and how those subawards will be implemented. Therefore, it is important to connect with each Center directly about how to best proceed. \u200b \u200b Johanna Herron Intertribal Food Business Center Project Director johanna@indianag.org STAY INFORMED If you have questions specific to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service’s portfolio of  Regional Food Business Center  efforts, we encourage you to reach out to Amber Marlow Tribal Outreach Coordinator Impact Fellow Amber.Marlow@usda.gov Non-Discrimination Statement And Justice for All Poster Know Your Rights Poster In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, family/parental status, income derived from a public assistance program, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity, in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA (not all bases apply to all programs).

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.  History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.  The main site for Archive Team is at  archiveteam.org  and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.    The Archive Team Panic Downloads  are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

They will conduct outreach to underserved communities and businesses.     Technical Assistance  - The Regional Food Centers will provide direct business technical assistance to small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses (producers, processors, distributors, and other businesses within the food supply chain) and food value and supply chain coordination. Each Regional Food Center will identify priority areas for technical assistance\u202f(e.g.,\u202faggregation/distribution, specialty crop processing for institutions) for the region it plans to serve.   Capacity Building  - The Regional Food Centers will provide financial assistance through business builder sub awards up to $100,000 to support projects focused on emerging regional needs and businesses that are working towards expansion and other investments. These sub awards may support staff time, business planning activities, capital purchases, equipment, marketing, product development costs, and more.

TIMESTAMPS                     top of page Providing\xa0 technical assistance and capacity-building opportunities  for Native food producers Intertribal Agriculture Council (IAC) will establish the Intertribal Food Business Center—the only USDA food business center prioritizing Indian Country—to impact the greater food system nationwide. This investment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities directs resources toward healing broken food systems that have underserved and exploited Native peoples for centuries. There is a great need for a Native-led organization to create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities, and IAC is uniquely equipped to lead this effort. \u200b The Intertribal Food Business Center will work to create new markets and expand current linkages throughout the supply chain to address challenges faced by Native food and farm businesses. IAC will partner with other Native organizations—including  Akiptan , the  Indian Land Tenure Foundation , and the  Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative —to develop a coordinated national food system development plan that supports the growth and expansion of American Indian and Alaska Native food businesses. The focus will be on small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses, with more than 65% of the funding allocated for capacity-building awards. \u200b Offerings of the Intertribal Food Business Center may be accessed by any Native producer. The Intertribal Food Business Center aims to be supportive and inclusive of the needs of Indian Country's food systems and food system stewards. Our intention is to serve food systems stewards who may identify as farmers, ranchers, fishers, gatherers, value-added food producers, food product aggregators, distributors, food business owners, and more. We will intentionally define our eligibility criteria to be inclusive in every way possible as we are aware of the historical exclusion from USDA funding support that Indian Country food systems stewards have endured. The  Regional Food Business Centers  and the Intertribal Food Business Center offer Native producers the opportunity for both expanded Technical Assistance Support and Business Builder Awards. As a Native producer, you may receive Technical Assistance Support from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. There is no limit to the amount of Technical Assistance Support you can pursue between the Centers. As a Native producer, you may seek Business Builder Awards from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. The total Business Builder Awards received by a single entity cannot exceed $100,000 between both Centers. \u200b Regional Centers are located in the following areas:   Appalachia   Delta   Rio Grande Colonias   Great Lakes Midwest   Heartland   Islands & Remote Areas   North Central   Northeast   Northwest & Rocky Mountain   Southeast   Southwest  EMPOWER Uplift Native producers with increased investment and support GROWTH Developing the abilities, processes, and resources agribusinesses need to adapt\xa0 REBUILD Create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities “With over 35 years of experience in food and business development work, the Intertribal Agriculture Council is excited about this opportunity to expand access to Native food producers and Tribal food systems that empower self-determination in Indian Country. Our collaboration with the USDA in standing up the Intertribal Food Business Center will heal broken food systems and build sustainable economic growth for our communities.” Kari Jo Lawrence  The Food Centers will have three main responsibilities: Coordination \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will act as regional hubs coordinating across geographic areas, with USDA, other federal, state, and tribal agencies with relevant resources, regional commissions, and the other Regional Food Centers. They will conduct outreach to underserved communities and businesses. Technical Assistance \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide direct business technical assistance to small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses (producers, processors, distributors, and other businesses within the food supply chain) and food value and supply chain coordination. Each Regional Food Center will identify priority areas for technical assistance\u202f(e.g.,\u202faggregation/distribution, specialty crop processing for institutions) for the region it plans to serve. Capacity Building \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide financial assistance through business builder subawards up to $100,000 to support projects focused on emerging regional needs and businesses that are working towards expansion and other investment. These subawards may support staff time, business planning activities, software implementation, the purchase of equipment, such as food safety, processing and packaging equipment, value chain and supply chain coordination and innovation, product development, marketing, and other expenses as outlined in the RFA. \u200b \u200b Our business is interested in the Business Builder awards. How can we learn more about them?  Businesses that are interested in applying for a capacity building subaward through an USDA Regional Food Business Center should directly contact the organization leading the Center that represents their respective geographical location. You can find a list of each organization that is leading a Center, along with a map demonstrating the regional coverage of each Center, on the\xa0 Overview page \xa0of the Regional Food Business Center website. While subawards are critical components of all 12 Regional Food Business Centers, each Center is taking a slightly different approach to how businesses can apply for a subaward and how those subawards will be implemented. Therefore, it is important to connect with each Center directly about how to best proceed. \u200b \u200b Johanna Herron Intertribal Food Business Center Project Director johanna@indianag.org STAY INFORMED If you have questions specific to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service’s portfolio of  Regional Food Business Center  efforts, we encourage you to reach out to Amber Marlow Tribal Outreach Coordinator Impact Fellow Amber.Marlow@usda.gov Non-Discrimination Statement And Justice for All Poster Know Your Rights Poster In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, family/parental status, income derived from a public assistance program, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity, in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA (not all bases apply to all programs).

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.  History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.  The main site for Archive Team is at  archiveteam.org  and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.    The Archive Team Panic Downloads  are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

TIMESTAMPS                     top of page Providing\xa0 technical assistance and capacity-building opportunities  for Native food producers Intertribal Agriculture Council (IAC) will establish the Intertribal Food Business Center—the only USDA food business center prioritizing Indian Country—to impact the greater food system nationwide. This investment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities directs resources toward healing broken food systems that have underserved and exploited Native peoples for centuries. There is a great need for a Native-led organization to create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities, and IAC is uniquely equipped to lead this effort. \u200b The Intertribal Food Business Center will work to create new markets and expand current linkages throughout the supply chain to address challenges faced by Native food and farm businesses. IAC will partner with other Native organizations—including  Akiptan , the  Indian Land Tenure Foundation , and the  Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative —to develop a coordinated national food system development plan that supports the growth and expansion of American Indian and Alaska Native food businesses. The focus will be on small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses, with more than 65% of the funding allocated for capacity-building awards. \u200b Offerings of the Intertribal Food Business Center may be accessed by any Native producer. The Intertribal Food Business Center aims to be supportive and inclusive of the needs of Indian Country's food systems and food system stewards. Our intention is to serve food systems stewards who may identify as farmers, ranchers, fishers, gatherers, value-added food producers, food product aggregators, distributors, food business owners, and more. We will intentionally define our eligibility criteria to be inclusive in every way possible as we are aware of the historical exclusion from USDA funding support that Indian Country food systems stewards have endured. The  Regional Food Business Centers  and the Intertribal Food Business Center offer Native producers the opportunity for both expanded Technical Assistance Support and Business Builder Awards. As a Native producer, you may receive Technical Assistance Support from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. There is no limit to the amount of Technical Assistance Support you can pursue between the Centers. As a Native producer, you may seek Business Builder Awards from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. The total Business Builder Awards received by a single entity cannot exceed $100,000 between both Centers. \u200b Regional Centers are located in the following areas: EMPOWER Uplift Native producers with increased investment and support GROWTH Developing the abilities, processes, and resources agribusinesses need to adapt\xa0 REBUILD Create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities “With over 35 years of experience in food and business development work, the Intertribal Agriculture Council is excited about this opportunity to expand access to Native food producers and Tribal food systems that empower self-determination in Indian Country. Our collaboration with the USDA in standing up the Intertribal Food Business Center will heal broken food systems and build sustainable economic growth for our communities.” Kari Jo Lawrence  The Food Centers will have three main responsibilities: Coordination \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will act as regional hubs coordinating across geographic areas, with USDA, other federal, state, and tribal agencies with relevant resources, regional commissions, and the other Regional Food Centers. They will conduct outreach to underserved communities and businesses. Technical Assistance \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide direct business technical assistance to small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses (producers, processors, distributors, and other businesses within the food supply chain) and food value and supply chain coordination. Each Regional Food Center will identify priority areas for technical assistance\u202f(e.g.,\u202faggregation/distribution, specialty crop processing for institutions) for the region it plans to serve. Capacity Building \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide financial assistance through business builder subawards up to $100,000 to support projects focused on emerging regional needs and businesses that are working towards expansion and other investment. These subawards may support staff time, business planning activities, software implementation, the purchase of equipment, such as food safety, processing and packaging equipment, value chain and supply chain coordination and innovation, product development, marketing, and other expenses as outlined in the RFA. \u200b \u200b Our business is interested in the Business Builder awards. How can we learn more about them?  Businesses that are interested in applying for a capacity building subaward through an USDA Regional Food Business Center should directly contact the organization leading the Center that represents their respective geographical location. You can find a list of each organization that is leading a Center, along with a map demonstrating the regional coverage of each Center, on the\xa0 Overview page \xa0of the Regional Food Business Center website. While subawards are critical components of all 12 Regional Food Business Centers, each Center is taking a slightly different approach to how businesses can apply for a subaward and how those subawards will be implemented. Therefore, it is important to connect with each Center directly about how to best proceed. \u200b \u200b Johanna Herron Intertribal Food Business Center Project Director johanna@indianag.org STAY INFORMED If you have questions specific to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service’s portfolio of  Regional Food Business Center  efforts, we encourage you to reach out to Amber Marlow Tribal Outreach Coordinator Impact Fellow Amber.Marlow@usda.gov Non-Discrimination Statement And Justice for All Poster Know Your Rights Poster In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, family/parental status, income derived from a public assistance program, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity, in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA (not all bases apply to all programs).

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.  History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.  The main site for Archive Team is at  archiveteam.org  and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

TIMESTAMPS                     top of page Providing\xa0 technical assistance and capacity-building opportunities  for Native food producers Intertribal Agriculture Council (IAC) will establish the Intertribal Food Business Center—the only USDA food business center prioritizing Indian Country—to impact the greater food system nationwide. This investment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities directs resources toward healing broken food systems that have underserved and exploited Native peoples for centuries. There is a great need for a Native-led organization to create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities, and IAC is uniquely equipped to lead this effort. \u200b The Intertribal Food Business Center will work to create new markets and expand current linkages throughout the supply chain to address challenges faced by Native food and farm businesses. IAC will partner with other Native organizations—including  Akiptan , the  Indian Land Tenure Foundation , and the  Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative —to develop a coordinated national food system development plan that supports the growth and expansion of American Indian and Alaska Native food businesses. The focus will be on small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses, with more than 65% of the funding allocated for capacity-building awards. \u200b Offerings of the Intertribal Food Business Center may be accessed by any Native producer. The Intertribal Food Business Center aims to be supportive and inclusive of the needs of Indian Country's food systems and food system stewards. Our intention is to serve food systems stewards who may identify as farmers, ranchers, fishers, gatherers, value-added food producers, food product aggregators, distributors, food business owners, and more. We will intentionally define our eligibility criteria to be inclusive in every way possible as we are aware of the historical exclusion from USDA funding support that Indian Country food systems stewards have endured. The  Regional Food Business Centers  and the Intertribal Food Business Center offer Native producers the opportunity for both expanded Technical Assistance Support and Business Builder Awards. As a Native producer, you may receive Technical Assistance Support from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. There is no limit to the amount of Technical Assistance Support you can pursue between the Centers. As a Native producer, you may seek Business Builder Awards from both the Intertribal Food Business Center and your Regional Food Business Center. The total Business Builder Awards received by a single entity cannot exceed $100,000 between both Centers. \u200b Regional Centers are located in the following areas: EMPOWER Uplift Native producers with increased investment and support GROWTH Developing the abilities, processes, and resources agribusinesses need to adapt\xa0 REBUILD Create Native-serving food systems that cater to Native communities “With over 35 years of experience in food and business development work, the Intertribal Agriculture Council is excited about this opportunity to expand access to Native food producers and Tribal food systems that empower self-determination in Indian Country. Our collaboration with the USDA in standing up the Intertribal Food Business Center will heal broken food systems and build sustainable economic growth for our communities.” Kari Jo Lawrence  The Food Centers will have three main responsibilities: Coordination \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will act as regional hubs coordinating across geographic areas, with USDA, other federal, state, and tribal agencies with relevant resources, regional commissions, and the other Regional Food Centers. They will conduct outreach to underserved communities and businesses. Technical Assistance \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide direct business technical assistance to small- and mid-sized food and farm businesses (producers, processors, distributors, and other businesses within the food supply chain) and food value and supply chain coordination. Each Regional Food Center will identify priority areas for technical assistance\u202f(e.g.,\u202faggregation/distribution, specialty crop processing for institutions) for the region it plans to serve. Capacity Building \xa0- The Regional Food Centers will provide financial assistance through business builder subawards up to $100,000 to support projects focused on emerging regional needs and businesses that are working towards expansion and other investment. These subawards may support staff time, business planning activities, software implementation, the purchase of equipment, such as food safety, processing and packaging equipment, value chain and supply chain coordination and innovation, product development, marketing, and other expenses as outlined in the RFA. \u200b \u200b Our business is interested in the Business Builder awards. How can we learn more about them?  Businesses that are interested in applying for a capacity building subaward through an USDA Regional Food Business Center should directly contact the organization leading the Center that represents their respective geographical location. You can find a list of each organization that is leading a Center, along with a map demonstrating the regional coverage of each Center, on the\xa0 Overview page \xa0of the Regional Food Business Center website. While subawards are critical components of all 12 Regional Food Business Centers, each Center is taking a slightly different approach to how businesses can apply for a subaward and how those subawards will be implemented. Therefore, it is important to connect with each Center directly about how to best proceed. \u200b \u200b Johanna Herron Intertribal Food Business Center Project Director johanna@indianag.org STAY INFORMED If you have questions specific to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service’s portfolio of  Regional Food Business Center  efforts, we encourage you to reach out to Amber Marlow Tribal Outreach Coordinator Impact Fellow Amber.Marlow@usda.gov Non-Discrimination Statement And Justice for All Poster Know Your Rights Poster In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, family/parental status, income derived from a public assistance program, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity, in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA (not all bases apply to all programs).

That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page\'s authors.  The goal is to  fix all broken links on the web .  Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.  History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.  The main site for Archive Team is at  archiveteam.org  and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
